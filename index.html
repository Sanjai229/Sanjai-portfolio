<h1>Sanjai Arul</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
Master’s student in Data Science at Adelaide University.<br>
Focused on building end-to-end machine learning systems with real audio data
and understanding their limitations in production-like settings.
</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I build end-to-end machine learning systems with a focus on speech processing,
data pipelines, and real-world deployment constraints.
</p>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<div class="project-box">

    <p class="project-title">
        Speech Recognition and Gender Detection System
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="project-section">Problem & Motivation</span><br>
        Most speech-based applications demonstrate transcription using pre-recorded
        datasets, without addressing real-time microphone input or downstream audio
        analytics. I wanted to build an end-to-end system that captures live speech
        from a browser, performs transcription, and extracts speaker-level insights
        under real-world constraints such as inconsistent audio formats and noise.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="project-section">System Design</span><br>
        The system uses a browser-based audio recorder to capture speech and send it
        as a POST request to a Flask backend. The backend standardises the audio into
        WAV format, performs speech-to-text transcription using Whisper, extracts MFCC
        features from the same audio, and predicts speaker gender using a trained
        Random Forest model. Results are returned as JSON and rendered dynamically
        on the frontend.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="project-section">Key Challenges</span><br>
        – Converting browser-recorded audio into a consistent WAV format for ML models<br>
        – Ensuring feature consistency between MFCC extraction during training and inference<br>
        – Debugging end-to-end failures across frontend, backend, and model layers
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="project-section">Trade-offs & Learnings</span><br>
        I prioritised robustness and system clarity over aggressive optimisation.
        This project strengthened my understanding of audio preprocessing pipelines,
        model integration in production-style systems, and how ML performance depends
        heavily on data handling rather than model choice alone in real-world systems.

<!-- Project 2 -->
<div class="project-box">

    <p class="project-title">
        Customer Churn Prediction Web Application
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="project-section">Problem & Motivation</span><br>
        Customer churn is a critical business problem, but many machine learning projects
        stop at model accuracy and notebooks without demonstrating how predictions are
        consumed in real-world systems. I wanted to build a production-style churn
        prediction application that not only trains a reliable ML model, but also exposes
        it through a public web interface where non-technical users can input customer
        details and receive interpretable churn predictions in real time.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="project-section">System Design</span><br>
        The system follows a clear frontend–backend–model architecture. A HTML-based form
        collects customer attributes and sends them as a POST request to a FastAPI backend.
        The backend performs strict feature alignment, including numeric scaling using a
        pre-fitted StandardScaler and manual one-hot encoding to exactly match the model’s
        training schema. A trained Random Forest classifier is then used to generate churn
        predictions and probabilities. Results are rendered back to the frontend using
        Jinja2 templates and deployed as a public web service on Render.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="project-section">Key Challenges</span><br>
        – Ensuring exact feature name and ordering consistency between training and inference<br>
        – Handling categorical encoding and numeric scaling outside the training pipeline<br>
        – Debugging deployment-time failures related to missing dependencies and form parsing<br>
        – Designing backend logic robust enough to handle partial or user-generated input
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="project-section">Trade-offs & Learnings</span><br>
        I prioritised correctness, debuggability, and production realism over rapid prototyping.
        This meant explicitly managing preprocessing steps instead of relying on implicit
        pipelines. The project deepened my understanding of how most ML deployment failures
        arise not from model choice, but from feature mismatches, data handling, and
        environment inconsistencies. It also strengthened my ability to debug full-stack ML
        systems across frontend, backend, and deployment layers.
